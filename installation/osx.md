# Dependencies

* Install Xcode Command Line Tools (last version availableâ€”open Xcode, Tools, More Tools, connect with your Apple Id)
* Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)

# Ruby

First, we need rbenv:

* `brew install rbenv ruby-build`

Open your bash profile (on OSX, it should be `~/.bash_profile`) and add at the end:

* `eval "$(rbenv init -)"`
